NW.js 0.14.0-rc2 is released in Beta branch with latest Chromium beta 50.0.2661.57. Node.js is updated to 5.9.1.

See upstream blog for exciting new features and improvements in Chromium 50: http://blog.chromium.org/2016/03/chrome-50-beta-push-notification.html

Following our release plan in 2016, we want to release a new major version as soon as a new Chromium stable release. That means 0.14.0 should be released soon after Chromium 50 released as stable version, which is expected to happen in mid April. So 0.14.0 rc versions are released now for preview and test purpose. Please try it and give your valuable feedback.

We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable; and a beta branch on Chromium beta. The beta branch contains all the fixes committed to the stable branch.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.

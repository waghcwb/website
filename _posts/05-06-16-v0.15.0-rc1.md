NW.js 0.15.0-rc1 is released with latest Chromium beta 51.0.2704.36. Node.js is updated to v6.1.0. It also contains bug fixes which will be released with 0.14.4.

In Chrome 51 upstream introduced support for **passive event listeners** and **Intersection Observer**, two emerging web standards that help developers create engaging, efficient experiences. See blog [New APIs to help developers improve scroll performance in Chromium 51](http://blog.chromium.org/2016/05/new-apis-to-help-developers-improve.html) for these 2 features. See also more exciting new features and improvements in Chromium 51: http://blog.chromium.org/2016/04/chrome-51-beta-credential-management.html ;

Following our release plan in 2016, we want to release a new major version as soon as a new Chromium stable release. That means 0.15.0 should be released soon after Chromium 51 released as stable version, which is expected to happen in late May. So 0.15.0 testing versions are released now for preview and test purpose. Please try it and give your valuable feedback.

We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable; and a beta branch on Chromium beta. The beta branch contains all the fixes committed to the stable branch.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.

Binaries for other platforms: http://dl.nwjs.io/v0.15.0-rc1/ 

There are 2 builds for each platform - normal build, and SDK build. Normal build doesn't have devtools, only SDK build does. lt can be opened by pressing F12 (Cmd-Alt-I on OSX). SDK packages also have more development tools to be exposed in the following releases, as well as the NaCl support. The NaCl build flavor in 0.14 and 0.13 was dropped due to [very low usage and feedback](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nwjs-general/uyNwqEPowd0/RfIDu1EIBQAJ)

Our build infrastructure enables live binary build from git tip so you can access to the latest binary from http://dl.nwjs.io/live-build/

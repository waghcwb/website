# {{title}}
{{date}}

We are pleased to announce NW.js 0.13.0-rc2. Chromium is updated to 49.0.2623.87 with security fixes; Node.js is updated to 5.8.0.

This release contains bug fixes reported by the users. We'll continue to fix reported issues as we are approaching the final release, which is scheduled in this month.

The notable changes in this release is:
* support node-main
* Build ffmpeg as Dll and [docs](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/For%20Developers/Enable%20Proprietary%20Codecs/) so users can build their own containing propietary codecs if they have the license (#4492, #4510)
* The .pak files for non-English languages are shipped in the SDK build
* Support migrating data in indexed db from 0.12
* Don't restore the dimensions for the main window to honor the width/height fields in manifest; this is done by not providing the window id when the main window is created. If you want the old behavior, provide a 'id' in 'window' in the manifest.

If you're new to version 0.13, please read http://nwjs.io/blog/v0.13.0-beta1/

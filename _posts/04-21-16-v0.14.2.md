{{date}}

NW.js 0.14.2 is released to sync up with the latest Chromium stable 50.0.2661.86, and including fixes we made during these days. A 'oncanel' event is added to the File input dialog to capture the cancel event.

This release focuses on the upstream rebase for our plan of releasing soon after every Chromium stable releases. Upstream's windows release is 50.0.2661.87 but the code is identical to 50.0.2661.86 except the version string. See http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2016/04/stable-channel-update_20.html

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later version, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.

# {{title}}

We are pleased to announce NW.js 0.13.0-beta6. Chromium 48 is updated to 48.0.2564.109 from 48.0.2564.97.
Node.js is updated to v5.6.0. Multiple bugs were fixed and a few features left in 0.12 were ported.

NW.js is able to support native modules built by node-gyp/npm now. 'nw-gyp' is not needed any more. See more information here: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nwjs-general/UqEq8ito2gI/W-ld9LSoDQAJ

We'll look into upgrading to Chromium 49 before RC release.

Chromium 48 brings exciting changes including custom buttons in the notification; VP9 as the codec for WebRTC, see http://blog.chromium.org/2015/12/chrome-48-beta-present-to-cast-devices_91.html . You can use them in your NW app today.

An important internal change in this release is that the Window object returned by nw.Window.get() resides in the background page. It's a 'shadow' object and its prototype points to the actual (inner) Window object in DOM context, which we returned by the function in previous releases. This change is for supporting navigation in the target window. After navigation, the previously returned Window object is still functional and its prototype is updated with the new inner Window object. This change doesn't affect our API.

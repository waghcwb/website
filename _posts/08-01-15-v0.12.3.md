While we are working actively on the next major version, we're still keep  maintaining the stable branch and released 0.12.3.

This release adds a new build flavor to support Mac App Store. Thanks to Trevor Linton, Alexey Stoletny,  Johan Satg√© and  Wang Chi for their work on this. The build has been verified with a successful submission to Mac App Store. See the document here: https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/Mac-App-Store-%28MAS%29-Submission-Guideline  and the discussion: https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/3609

A new API Screen.DesktopCaptureMonitor is added to support the similar feature in Chrome App. See

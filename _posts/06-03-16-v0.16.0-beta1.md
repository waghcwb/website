We're pleased to announce NW.js 0.16.0-beta1 in beta branch.

Chromium 52 beta contains under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore. See the upstream announcement for more information: http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2016/06/beta-channel-update.html

We've made the 0.16 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 52 in the same day. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a LTS branch which will be supported for the next 2 years.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.

Binary for other platforms: http://dl.nwjs.io/v0.16.0-beta1/ 

There are 2 builds for each platform - normal build, and SDK build. Normal build doesn't have devtools, only SDK build does. lt can be opened by pressing F12 (Cmd-Alt-I on OSX). SDK packages also have more development tools to be exposed in the following releases, as well as the NaCl support. The NaCl build flavor in 0.14 and 0.13 was dropped due to [very low usage and feedback](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nwjs-general/uyNwqEPowd0/RfIDu1EIBQAJ)

Our build infrastructure enables live binary build from git tip so you can access to the latest binary from http://dl.nwjs.io/live-build/

title: NW.js v0.14.0-rc1 Released in Beta Branch

NW.js 0.14.0-rc1 is released in Beta branch with latest Chromium beta 50.0.2661.49.

See upstream blog for exciting new features and improvements in Chromium 50: http://blog.chromium.org/2016/03/chrome-50-beta-push-notification.html

Following our release plan in 2016, we want to release a new major version as soon as a new Chromium stable release. That means 0.14.0 should be released soon after Chromium 50 released as stable version, which is expected to happen in mid April. So 0.14.0-rc1 is released now for preview and test purpose. Please try it and give your valuable feedback.

We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable; and a beta branch on Chromium beta. The beta branch contains all the fixes committed to the stable branch.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.

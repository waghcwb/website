NW.js 0.13.4 is released to sync up with the latest Chromium stable 49.0.2623.112, and including fixes we made during these days.

This release focuses on the upstream rebase for our plan of releasing soon after every Chromium stable releases. We've released updates within 24hrs following upstream in past versions. This is helpful to deliver (security) fixes to our users in time.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.

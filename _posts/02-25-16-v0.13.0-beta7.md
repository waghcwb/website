# {{title}}

We are pleased to announce NW.js 0.13.0-beta7. Chromium 48 is updated to 48.0.2564.116 from 48.0.2564.109.

NW.js is now able to support devtools extensions, including the one for ReactJS etc. To use them, see http://docs.nwjs.io/en/v0.13.0-beta7/For%20Users/Debugging%20with%20DevTools/#using-devtools-extensions

A method is added to webview tag, so you can launch devtools for this webview. Besides opening a new window, You can also place the devtools UI in a webview. This enables IDE software for better UI. See the doc for more information: http://docs.nwjs.io/en/v0.13.0-beta7/References/webview%20Tag/#webviewshowdevtoolsshow-container

If you're new to this major new beta version 0.13, please read http://nwjs.io/blog/v0.13.0-beta1/

An important internal change in this release is that the Window object returned by nw.Window.get() resides in the background page. It's a 'shadow' object and its prototype points to the actual (inner) Window object in DOM context, which we returned by the function in previous releases. This change is for supporting navigation in the target window. After navigation, the previously returned Window object is still functional and its prototype is updated with the new inner Window object. This change doesn't affect our API.
